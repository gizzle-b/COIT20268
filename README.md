Assessment 2 for course Responsive Web Design

Task Description:

Create a website with HTML5 and CSS3 as specified for the course. The website should demonstrate functionality and interactivity between the components rendered and the end user. The components should incorporate text, images, colour and if required, media elements.

Learning Outcome:

1. Develop web pages tailored for a rangle of screen resolutions, incorporating text, images, audio and video.
2. Apply principles of progressive enhancement to optimise content for the limited memory and processing power of mobile devices, whilst simultaneously delivering a richer experience on non-mobile devices.

Specification

Design and develop a website. The idea is to provide information to tourists visiting the museum. The goal is to allow visitors to obtain an overview of the museum layout and to find details of exhibits they would like to visit.

Resources

Resources such as images and details of opening hours can be found in ProResource.ZIP. The content of the ZIP file is:

1. Three folders named Robots, DaVinci and Vehicles. Each folder contains images relating to the different types of technology indicated by the name of its folder.
2. A text file Artefact_List.txt contains the names of the artefact corresponding to each of the image from each folder. You need to use these names as the official description of the artefact on your web site.
3. A text file Time_Fees.txt containing the time-table of opening hours and entrance fees to the museum.
4. Logo.png – an image of the logo of the museum.
5. Navigation_Map.jpg – floor layout of the museum.

General Requirements

The managers of SAT insist that the following requirements must be adhered to:

1. Each webpage of the website must display the SAT logo.
2. Do not change the description of the artefacts. Do not rename the filenames of any of the images.
3. All images of each artefact must be presented to the visitor. This can be done within one webpage or distributed across several web pages. The idea is to ensure that visitors are made aware of the complete selection of items available for them to visit.
4. The images are to be used as it is. You can resize the images retaining the original aspect ratio, but do not crop or edit (e.g. recolour, touch up, sharpen, etc.) or rename the images in any way. 5. Generate a separate page providing the opening hours and entrance fees. The details are found in the Time_Fees.txt file.
6. Text description for each artifact is not provided. You can provide your own ‘dummy’ text to demonstrate the functionality of your web page design.

Example of Users Interacting with the Website

The visitor to the website will be greeted by a welcome message and the following layout of the floor plan of the museum. The visitor clicks on any of the exhibition hall (circles). It should bring up details of the specific hall selected with relevant artefacts. The visitor clicks on any of the images of the artefacts to obtain further information on that image. In addition, if the visitor selects an option to display opening hours and/or entrance fees, a separate page should appear to provide this information. Note this is the basic requirement, it is up to you to implement other details e.g. instructions, navigational control, etc.
